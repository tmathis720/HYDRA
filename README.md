# Hydra Project

Hydra is an advanced computational framework designed for geophysical fluid dynamics simulations. It uses Finite Volume Methods (FVM) on unstructured 3D meshes to deliver robust, scalable, and accurate solutions for complex fluid flow problems. With a modular architecture, Hydra is a flexible tool for researchers and engineers working on diverse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications.

## Features
- **Finite Volume Method (FVM):** A reliable approach for solving partial differential equations over arbitrary 3D geometries.
- **Unstructured Mesh Support:** Handles complex domains with high flexibility in grid generation and adaptation.
- **Geophysical Applications:** Tailored for large-scale fluid flow simulations, including atmospheric, oceanic, and subsurface applications.
- **Modular Design:** Independent modules for solvers, mesh handling, boundary conditions, and physical models allow for easy customization and extension.

## Current Status
Hydra is actively under development. The current focus is on enhancing the following aspects:
- Improving solver efficiency and scalability.
- Expanding test coverage for key modules.
- Refining boundary condition handling for a variety of flow scenarios.
- Documentation and codebase organization for easier contributions.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Rust:** Hydra is implemented in Rust, leveraging its performance and memory safety features.
- **Cargo:** Use Cargo to build and manage dependencies.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tmathis720/hydra.git
   cd hydra
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. Run tests to verify the installation:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

### Example Usage
Hydra can be run with configuration files that define the mesh, boundary conditions, and simulation parameters:
```bash
./hydra simulate --config ./examples/config.yaml
```
