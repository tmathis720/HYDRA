### Summary of the Boundary Condition Module

This module is responsible for handling Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions in the context of a computational fluid dynamics simulation or finite volume method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Below is a detailed explanation of the individual files and how they function within the module.

---

#### **1. `dirichlet.rs` - Dirichlet Boundary Condition**

The `DirichletBC` struct is used to apply Dirichlet boundary conditions, which prescribe fixed values on certain boundary entities of the computational domain (e.g., setting velocity or pressure to a fixed value at the boundary).

**Key Components**:
- `FxHashMap<MeshEntity, f64>`: Maps boundary mesh entities to their prescribed Dirichlet values.
  
**Key Functions**:
- **`new`**: Initializes a new Dirichlet boundary condition structure.
- **`set_bc`**: Assigns a Dirichlet boundary value to a specific mesh entity.
- **`is_bc`**: Checks whether a Dirichlet boundary condition is applied to a mesh entity.
- **`get_value`**: Retrieves the Dirichlet boundary value for a given entity.
- **`apply_bc`**: Modifies the system matrix and right-hand-side (RHS) vector to apply the Dirichlet boundary conditions. It alters the system such that the corresponding matrix row is set to zero except for the diagonal, and the RHS is set to the prescribed boundary value.

#### **2. `neumann.rs` - Neumann Boundary Condition**

The `NeumannBC` struct applies Neumann boundary conditions, which specify the flux across a boundary rather than the value. This can be used for problems like heat flux, fluid outflow, etc.

**Key Components**:
- `FxHashMap<MeshEntity, f64>`: Maps boundary mesh entities (faces) to flux values.

**Key Functions**:
- **`new`**: Initializes the Neumann boundary condition structure.
- **`set_bc`**: Assigns a flux value to a boundary mesh entity (face).
- **`apply_bc`**: Modifies the RHS vector to account for the Neumann boundary conditions. The flux is multiplied by the area of the face and added to the RHS corresponding to the face's adjacent cell.

#### **3. `mod.rs` - Module Integration**

This file integrates both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition structures into a cohesive module. The functions and structs from both `dirichlet.rs` and `neumann.rs` are made available for use, allowing easy access to these boundary conditions from other parts of the code.

### How to Use the Module

1. **Dirichlet Boundary Condition Example**:
   - Create a new `DirichletBC` structure:
     ```rust
     let mut dirichlet_bc = DirichletBC::new();
     ```
   - Set boundary conditions:
     ```rust
     dirichlet_bc.set_bc(mesh_entity, 5.0);  // Set a value of 5.0 for a boundary entity
     ```
   - Apply the boundary conditions to the system matrix and RHS:
     ```rust
     dirichlet_bc.apply_bc(&mut matrix, &mut rhs, &entity_to_index);
     ```

2. **Neumann Boundary Condition Example**:
   - Create a new `NeumannBC` structure:
     ```rust
     let mut neumann_bc = NeumannBC::new();
     ```
   - Set flux values for the boundary faces:
     ```rust
     neumann_bc.set_bc(boundary_face, flux_value);
     ```
   - Apply the boundary conditions to the RHS:
     ```rust
     neumann_bc.apply_bc(&mut rhs, &face_to_cell_index, &face_areas);
     ```

This setup ensures that boundary conditions are applied correctly, both for fixed values (Dirichlet) and for fluxes (Neumann), making the system well-posed and ready for solution.
