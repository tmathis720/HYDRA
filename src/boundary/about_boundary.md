# Detailed Report on the Boundary Components of the HYDRA Project

## Overview

The boundary components of the HYDRA project, located in the `src/boundary/` directory, are crucial for applying boundary conditions in numerical simulations. Boundary conditions are essential for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) as they define how the solution behaves at the boundaries of the computational domain. The boundary components in HYDRA are designed to integrate seamlessly with the domain module, which manages the computational mesh and entities.

This report will provide a detailed analysis of the boundary components, focusing on their functionality, integration with the domain module, and potential future enhancements to streamline their usage within HYDRA.

## 1. `neumann.rs`

### Functionality

The `neumann.rs` module implements the `NeumannBC` struct, which handles Neumann boundary conditions in the simulation.

- **`NeumannBC` Struct**:

  - **Fields**:

    - `fluxes: FxHashMap<MeshEntity, f64>`: A mapping from mesh entities (typically boundary faces) to their specified flux values.

  - **Methods**:

    - `new() -> Self`: Constructs a new `NeumannBC` instance.

    - `set_bc(&mut self, entity: MeshEntity, flux: f64)`: Assigns a Neumann boundary condition (flux) to a mesh entity.

    - `is_bc(&self, entity: &MeshEntity) -> bool`: Checks if a mesh entity has a Neumann boundary condition applied.

    - `get_flux(&self, entity: &MeshEntity) -> f64`: Retrieves the flux value associated with a mesh entity.

    - `apply_bc(&self, rhs: &mut MatMut<f64>, face_to_cell_index: &FxHashMap<MeshEntity, usize>, face_areas: &FxHashMap<usize, f64>)`: Applies the Neumann boundary conditions to the right-hand side (RHS) vector of the linear system.

### Integration with the Domain Module

- **Mesh Entities**: The `NeumannBC` struct uses `MeshEntity` from the domain module to identify the mesh entities (faces) where Neumann conditions are applied.

- **Face to Cell Mapping**: It requires a mapping (`face_to_cell_index`) from boundary faces to the indices in the RHS vector. This mapping is typically derived from the mesh structure managed by the domain module.

- **Face Areas**: The application of Neumann conditions involves the face areas, which are geometric properties provided by the `Mesh` struct in the domain module.

- **Data Flow**:

  1. **Setting Boundary Conditions**:

     - Users specify which mesh entities (faces) have Neumann boundary conditions by calling `set_bc` and providing the flux values.

  2. **Applying Boundary Conditions**:

     - During the assembly of the linear system, `apply_bc` is called to update the RHS vector.

     - For each face with a Neumann condition, the flux value is multiplied by the face area and added to the corresponding entry in the RHS vector.

### Usage in HYDRA

- **Finite Volume Method (FVM)**: In FVM, Neumann boundary conditions represent specified fluxes across the boundary faces. The `NeumannBC` component ensures that these fluxes are correctly incorporated into the RHS vector during the assembly process.

- **Solver Integration**: By updating the RHS vector, the Neumann boundary conditions are seamlessly integrated into the linear system solved by the numerical solvers in HYDRA.

- **Example Usage**:

  ```rust
  // Create NeumannBC instance
  let mut neumann_bc = NeumannBC::new();

  // Set Neumann boundary condition on a face
  neumann_bc.set_bc(boundary_face_entity, flux_value);

  // During assembly
  neumann_bc.apply_bc(&mut rhs_vector, &face_to_cell_index, &face_areas);
  ```

### Potential Future Enhancements

- **Integration with `Section`**:

  - **Streamlining Data Association**: Instead of using a separate `FxHashMap` to store fluxes, consider using the `Section` structure from the domain module to associate flux values with mesh entities. This would provide consistency in data management across the project.

  - **Example**:

    ```rust
    // Using Section to store fluxes
    let mut flux_section = Section::<f64>::new();
    flux_section.set_data(boundary_face_entity, flux_value);
    ```

- **Boundary Condition Tags**:

  - **Improved Flexibility**: Introduce tagging mechanisms to categorize boundary entities (e.g., "inlet", "outlet") and associate default boundary conditions based on tags.

  - **Implementation**: Use `Section` or an attribute system to associate tags with entities and map tags to boundary condition functions or values.

- **Parallelization Support**:

  - **Scalability**: Enhance the `NeumannBC` component to support parallel computations by ensuring data structures are thread-safe and compatible with distributed memory systems.

- **Error Handling and Validation**:

  - **Robustness**: Implement checks to ensure that boundary conditions are only applied to appropriate entity types (e.g., faces) and provide informative error messages.

  - **Boundary Verification**: Add methods to verify that all necessary boundary entities have boundary conditions applied to prevent incomplete problem definitions.

## 2. `dirichlet.rs`

### Functionality

The `dirichlet.rs` module implements the `DirichletBC` struct, which handles Dirichlet boundary conditions.

- **`DirichletBC` Struct**:

  - **Fields**:

    - `values: FxHashMap<MeshEntity, f64>`: A mapping from mesh entities (typically boundary vertices or cells) to their prescribed values.

  - **Methods**:

    - `new() -> Self`: Constructs a new `DirichletBC` instance.

    - `set_bc(&mut self, entity: MeshEntity, value: f64)`: Assigns a Dirichlet boundary condition to a mesh entity.

    - `is_bc(&self, entity: &MeshEntity) -> bool`: Checks if a mesh entity has a Dirichlet boundary condition applied.

    - `get_value(&self, entity: &MeshEntity) -> f64`: Retrieves the value associated with a mesh entity.

    - `apply_bc(&self, matrix: &mut MatMut<f64>, rhs: &mut MatMut<f64>, entity_to_index: &FxHashMap<MeshEntity, usize>)`: Applies the Dirichlet boundary conditions to the system matrix and RHS vector.

### Integration with the Domain Module

- **Mesh Entities**: Uses `MeshEntity` to identify where Dirichlet conditions are applied.

- **Entity to Index Mapping**: Requires a mapping (`entity_to_index`) from mesh entities to matrix indices, which is derived from the mesh structure.

- **Data Flow**:

  1. **Setting Boundary Conditions**:

     - Users specify which mesh entities have Dirichlet boundary conditions using `set_bc`.

  2. **Applying Boundary Conditions**:

     - During system assembly, `apply_bc` modifies the system matrix and RHS vector.

     - For each entity with a Dirichlet condition:

       - The corresponding row in the system matrix is set to zero except for the diagonal element, which is set to one.

       - The RHS vector is updated with the prescribed value.

### Usage in HYDRA

- **Finite Volume Method**: Dirichlet conditions specify the value of the solution at certain points (e.g., fixed temperatures or velocities at boundaries).

- **Solver Integration**: By modifying the system matrix and RHS vector, the Dirichlet conditions are enforced in the linear system.

- **Example Usage**:

  ```rust
  // Create DirichletBC instance
  let mut dirichlet_bc = DirichletBC::new();

  // Set Dirichlet boundary condition on a vertex
  dirichlet_bc.set_bc(boundary_vertex_entity, value);

  // During assembly
  dirichlet_bc.apply_bc(&mut system_matrix, &mut rhs_vector, &entity_to_index);
  ```

### Potential Future Enhancements

- **Utilization of `Section`**:

  - **Consistent Data Management**: Use `Section` to associate Dirichlet values with mesh entities, providing a unified approach to data storage.

  - **Example**:

    ```rust
    // Using Section to store Dirichlet values
    let mut dirichlet_section = Section::<f64>::new();
    dirichlet_section.set_data(boundary_vertex_entity, value);
    ```

- **Function-Based Boundary Conditions**:

  - **Spatially Varying Conditions**: Extend `DirichletBC` to support boundary conditions defined by functions of space (and possibly time).

  - **Implementation**: Use closures or function pointers to represent boundary condition functions.

  - **Example**:

    ```rust
    type DirichletFn = Box<dyn Fn(&[f64]) -> f64 + Send + Sync>;

    let dirichlet_fn: DirichletFn = Box::new(|coords| {
        // Define condition based on coordinates
        coords[0] + coords[1]
    });

    // Associate function with boundary entity
    dirichlet_bc.set_bc(boundary_vertex_entity, dirichlet_fn);
    ```

- **Boundary Condition Tags and Regions**:

  - **Simplified Assignment**: Use tags or regions to assign Dirichlet conditions to groups of entities.

  - **Integration with `Section`**: Tags can be stored in a `Section<String>` and mapped to boundary conditions.

- **Parallelization and Scalability**:

  - **Distributed Systems**: Ensure `DirichletBC` works efficiently in parallel computing environments.

  - **Thread Safety**: Use thread-safe data structures and consider synchronization where necessary.

- **Error Handling and Validation**:

  - **Entity Type Checking**: Ensure that Dirichlet conditions are applied to valid entity types (e.g., vertices or cells).

  - **Comprehensive Error Messages**: Provide detailed error messages to aid in debugging.

## 3. Integration with the Domain Module

### Consistent Data Structures

- Both `NeumannBC` and `DirichletBC` rely on `FxHashMap` to associate boundary conditions with mesh entities. This is similar to how the `Section` struct in the domain module associates data with entities.

- **Recommendation**: Adopt the `Section` structure for storing boundary condition data to maintain consistency and leverage existing functionality.

  - **Advantages**:

    - **Uniform Interface**: Simplifies code by using a common method for data association.

    - **Extensibility**: `Section` supports generic data types, enabling easy extension to function-based boundary conditions.

### Mesh Entity Identification

- Boundary components interact with mesh entities defined in the domain module, relying on mappings between entities and indices in system matrices and vectors.

- **Integration Points**:

  - **Entity to Index Mappings**: These mappings are crucial for applying boundary conditions and should be maintained consistently across the project.

  - **Mesh Geometry**: Access to geometric properties (e.g., face areas) is essential for applying Neumann conditions.

### Potential Streamlining

- **Unified Boundary Condition Handler**:

  - **Concept**: Create a generic boundary condition handler that can manage different types of boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin) using polymorphism or enums.

  - **Implementation**:

    ```rust
    enum BoundaryCondition {
        Dirichlet(f64),
        Neumann(f64),
        Robin { alpha: f64, beta: f64 },
    }

    struct BoundaryConditionHandler {
        conditions: Section<BoundaryCondition>,
    }
    ```

  - **Benefits**:

    - **Simplifies Management**: Reduces the number of separate structures to manage boundary conditions.

    - **Extensibility**: Facilitates the addition of new boundary condition types.

- **Integration with Mesh Partitioning**:

  - **Parallel Environments**: Ensure that boundary conditions are correctly applied in partitioned meshes, accounting for ghost entities.

  - **Overlap Handling**: Use the `Overlap` struct from the domain module to manage boundary entities shared between processes.

- **Automated Boundary Detection**:

  - **Mesh Processing**: Implement methods to automatically detect boundary entities based on mesh topology and geometry.

  - **User Convenience**: Reduces the manual effort required to specify boundary conditions.
