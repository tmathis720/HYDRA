# Detailed Report on the Boundary Components of the HYDRA Project

## Overview

The boundary components of the HYDRA project, located in the `src/boundary/` directory, are crucial for applying boundary conditions in numerical simulations. Boundary conditions are essential for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), as they define how the solution behaves at the boundaries of the computational domain. The boundary components in HYDRA have been designed to integrate seamlessly with the domain module, which manages the computational mesh and entities.

This report provides a detailed analysis of the boundary components, focusing on their functionality, integration with the domain module, and the recent updates to streamline their usage within HYDRA.

## 1. `neumann.rs`

### Functionality

The `neumann.rs` module implements the `NeumannBC` struct, which handles Neumann boundary conditions in the simulation.

- **`NeumannBC` Struct**:

  - **Fields**:
    - `conditions: Section<BoundaryCondition>`: A mapping from mesh entities (typically boundary faces) to their specified Neumann flux values, using the `Section` struct for consistency.

  - **Methods**:

    - `new() -> Self`: Constructs a new `NeumannBC` instance.

    - `set_bc(&mut self, entity: MeshEntity, condition: BoundaryCondition)`: Assigns a Neumann boundary condition (constant or function-based) to a mesh entity.

    - `apply_bc(&self, rhs: &mut MatMut<f64>, entity_to_index: &FxHashMap<MeshEntity, usize>, time: f64)`: Applies the Neumann boundary conditions to the right-hand side (RHS) vector of the linear system.

    - `apply_constant_neumann(&self, rhs: &mut MatMut<f64>, index: usize, value: f64)`: Applies a constant Neumann condition by modifying the corresponding entry in the RHS vector.

### Integration with the Domain Module

- **Mesh Entities**: The `NeumannBC` struct uses `MeshEntity` from the domain module to identify where Neumann conditions are applied.

- **Entity to Index Mapping**: The `apply_bc` method requires a mapping (`entity_to_index`) from mesh entities to RHS vector indices, which is derived from the mesh structure.

- **Data Flow**:

  1. **Setting Boundary Conditions**:
     - Users specify which mesh entities have Neumann boundary conditions using `set_bc`.

  2. **Applying Boundary Conditions**:
     - During system assembly, `apply_bc` modifies the RHS vector based on the Neumann flux values associated with the entities.

### Recent Enhancements

- **Utilization of `Section`**:
  - We have integrated the `Section` structure to store fluxes for Neumann conditions, streamlining data management and consistency across boundary components.

- **Function-Based Neumann Conditions**:
  - Neumann conditions can now be defined as functions of space and time, allowing for more flexible simulations.

## 2. `dirichlet.rs`

### Functionality

The `dirichlet.rs` module implements the `DirichletBC` struct, which handles Dirichlet boundary conditions.

- **`DirichletBC` Struct**:

  - **Fields**:
    - `conditions: Section<BoundaryCondition>`: A mapping from mesh entities (typically boundary vertices or cells) to their prescribed values, using the `Section` struct.

  - **Methods**:

    - `new() -> Self`: Constructs a new `DirichletBC` instance.

    - `set_bc(&mut self, entity: MeshEntity, condition: BoundaryCondition)`: Assigns a Dirichlet boundary condition to a mesh entity (constant or function-based).

    - `apply_bc(&self, matrix: &mut MatMut<f64>, rhs: &mut MatMut<f64>, entity_to_index: &FxHashMap<MeshEntity, usize>, time: f64)`: Applies the Dirichlet boundary conditions to the system matrix and RHS vector.

    - `apply_constant_dirichlet(&self, matrix: &mut MatMut<f64>, rhs: &mut MatMut<f64>, index: usize, value: f64)`: Applies a constant Dirichlet condition by modifying the system matrix and RHS vector.

### Integration with the Domain Module

- **Mesh Entities**: The `DirichletBC` struct uses `MeshEntity` to identify where Dirichlet conditions are applied.

- **Entity to Index Mapping**: The `apply_bc` method requires a mapping (`entity_to_index`) from mesh entities to system matrix indices, which is derived from the mesh structure.

### Recent Enhancements

- **Utilization of `Section`**:
  - The `Section` structure now stores Dirichlet values, ensuring consistent data management across different boundary condition types.

- **Function-Based Boundary Conditions**:
  - Dirichlet conditions can now be spatially varying and defined as functions of time and space.

## 3. `robin.rs`

### Functionality

The `robin.rs` module implements the `RobinBC` struct, which handles Robin boundary conditions (a combination of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions).

- **`RobinBC` Struct**:

  - **Fields**:
    - `conditions: Section<BoundaryCondition>`: A mapping from mesh entities to their Robin boundary condition parameters (alpha, beta).

  - **Methods**:

    - `new() -> Self`: Constructs a new `RobinBC` instance.

    - `set_bc(&mut self, entity: MeshEntity, condition: BoundaryCondition)`: Assigns a Robin boundary condition to a mesh entity.

    - `apply_bc(&self, matrix: &mut MatMut<f64>, rhs: &mut MatMut<f64>, entity_to_index: &FxHashMap<MeshEntity, usize>, time: f64)`: Applies Robin boundary conditions by modifying both the system matrix and RHS vector.

    - `apply_robin(&self, matrix: &mut MatMut<f64>, rhs: &mut MatMut<f64>, index: usize, alpha: f64, beta: f64)`: Applies the Robin condition by adjusting the diagonal of the system matrix (using `alpha`) and modifying the RHS vector (using `beta`).

### Integration with the Domain Module

- **Mesh Entities**: The `RobinBC` struct uses `MeshEntity` from the domain module to identify the mesh entities where Robin conditions are applied.

- **Data Flow**:
  - Robin conditions modify both the system matrix and the RHS vector during system assembly.

### Recent Enhancements

- **Introduction of Robin Boundary Conditions**:
  - The Robin boundary condition implementation was added, allowing the project to handle mixed boundary conditions where both solution values and fluxes are specified.

## 4. Integration with the Domain Module

### Consistent Data Structures

- All boundary conditions (Neumann, Dirichlet, Robin) now use the `Section` structure for associating data with mesh entities, ensuring consistency in data management across the project.

### Mesh Entity Identification

- Boundary components rely on `MeshEntity` for interacting with the computational mesh.
- The interaction between boundary conditions and the mesh is facilitated by mappings between entities and indices in the system matrices and vectors.

### Potential Future Enhancements

- **Unified Boundary Condition Handler**:
  - The `BoundaryConditionHandler` currently supports multiple types of boundary conditions. Potential future enhancements could include further refactoring to unify the application of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions into a single, streamlined process.

## Conclusion

The boundary components of the HYDRA project play a vital role in applying boundary conditions within the simulation. The recent updates have improved consistency, flexibility, and functionality by integrating `Section` for data management and expanding support for function-based conditions. Robin boundary conditions have been successfully integrated, enhancing the project’s ability to simulate complex physical phenomena.

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Refactor Boundary Components**:
   - Continue refactoring to simplify and unify boundary condition management.
  
2. **Expand Testing**:
   - Further validate the boundary components with extensive testing, including edge cases and function-based conditions.

By following these recommendations, HYDRA can ensure that its boundary condition implementation remains robust and scalable, supporting a wide range of simulations in geophysical fluid dynamics.
