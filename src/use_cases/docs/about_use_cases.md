The `use_cases` module in Hydra implements specific operations that fulfill the needs of various higher-level application workflows. In a clean architecture, `use_cases` act as intermediaries between the core application logic and the lower-level modules like data handling, UI, or external interfaces. This structure promotes modularity, testability, and flexibility by separating domain logic from implementation details.

In Hydra, the `use_cases` module is designed to handle specialized tasks, such as creating and initializing matrices and right-hand side (RHS) vectors, which are essential in solving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) equations. By abstracting these tasks into separate use cases, Hydra can:
1. **Ensure Clear and Testable Operations**: Each use case is responsible for a well-defined operation, making it easy to test and validate.
2. **Encapsulate Domain-Specific Logic**: Use cases encapsulate the logic of matrix and RHS construction, initialization, and manipulation, keeping the core logic isolated from the specifics of data handling or external dependencies.
3. **Enable Flexibility and Reusability**: By separating use cases, other parts of Hydra (or even different projects) can reuse these operations without modification.

## Background: Clean Architecture Principles in Use Cases

In clean architecture:
- **Use Cases**: Represent application-specific operations (e.g., creating and setting up a matrix for CFD).
- **Entities**: Define core business objects (e.g., `Matrix`, `Vector`).
- **Interface Adapters**: Provide interfaces that handle implementation-specific details, like adapting external libraries or custom data structures to the Hydra environment.
  
By following this structure, `use_cases` operate independently of changes in interface adapters or low-level data handling, as they rely only on high-level interfaces. They bridge the gap between domain-specific tasks and the Hydra project's data structures.

### Key Concepts in `use_cases`

- **Single Responsibility**: Each use case file focuses on one operation, such as constructing a matrix (`matrix_construction.rs`) or creating an RHS vector (`rhs_construction.rs`).
- **Explicit Interfaces**: Use cases interact with data through interfaces, not concrete implementations, making it easy to replace dependencies or adjust workflows without altering core logic.
- **Dependency Inversion**: The `use_cases` module depends on high-level abstractions, like `MatrixOperations` and `Vector`, rather than specific implementations, promoting loose coupling.

## Overview of Use Cases in Hydra

### 1. `matrix_construction.rs`

This use case is responsible for creating and initializing matrices used in various computational tasks in Hydra. 

- **Purpose**: To build and set up matrices with specified dimensions and values, which can then be used in simulation workflows.
- **Functions**:
  - **`build_zero_matrix`**: Creates a new dense matrix with the specified number of rows and columns, initialized to zero. This function uses `MatrixAdapter` to ensure consistency in matrix creation across Hydra.
  - **`initialize_matrix_with_value`**: Fills an existing matrix with a specific value. This can be helpful for setting initial conditions in simulations.
  - **`resize_matrix`**: Changes the dimensions of a matrix, maintaining data where possible. It relies on the `ExtendedMatrixOperations` trait, ensuring the operation works consistently for matrices of different types.
  
  **Usage Example**:
  ```rust,ignore
  let mut matrix = MatrixConstruction::build_zero_matrix(4, 4);
  MatrixConstruction::initialize_matrix_with_value(&mut matrix, 1.0);
  MatrixConstruction::resize_matrix(&mut matrix, 6, 6);
  ```

  This setup constructs a 4x4 matrix filled with 1.0 and resizes it to 6x6.

### 2. `rhs_construction.rs`

This use case constructs and manages the right-hand side (RHS) vector used in solving linear systems, essential for CFD and other mathematical modeling tasks.

- **Purpose**: To build, initialize, and resize RHS vectors as needed in various computations within Hydra.
- **Functions**:
  - **`build_zero_rhs`**: Creates an RHS vector of a given size, initialized to zero, facilitating consistent initialization.
  - **`initialize_rhs_with_value`**: Sets each element in the RHS vector to a specified value. This is useful for setting boundary conditions or initial states in simulation workflows.
  - **`resize_rhs`**: Resizes the RHS vector, preserving existing data and initializing new entries to zero.

  **Usage Example**:
  ```rust,ignore
  let mut rhs_vector = RHSConstruction::build_zero_rhs(5);
  RHSConstruction::initialize_rhs_with_value(&mut rhs_vector, 3.5);
  RHSConstruction::resize_rhs(&mut rhs_vector, 8);
  ```

  This creates a 5-element vector filled with 3.5, then resizes it to 8 elements, initializing new elements to zero.

## Testing and Validation

Following Test-Driven Development (TDD), each function in `matrix_construction.rs` and `rhs_construction.rs` has a corresponding test to verify correct behavior.

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Isolation**: Each test targets a single function, ensuring each function behaves as expected in isolation.
2. **Consistency**: Tests ensure that matrix and vector creation, resizing, and initialization are consistent across Hydra, regardless of the underlying data structure or adapter.
3. **Boundary Cases**: Tests check edge cases, such as resizing matrices and vectors to larger or smaller dimensions, to validate data preservation and initialization.

### Summary

The `use_cases` module in Hydra:
- Adheres to clean architecture principles by encapsulating specific tasks, interfacing with high-level abstractions, and ensuring modular and flexible code.
- Provides reusable, testable, and consistent operations for initializing and managing matrices and RHS vectors, critical components in the Hydra project.

This modular structure enables developers to work confidently with Hydraâ€™s data structures, knowing the `use_cases` provide a stable, consistent foundation for their operations.
