## 1. `ts.rs`

### Functionality

The `ts.rs` file serves as the core of the `time_stepping` module, defining the primary traits and error types used for time-stepping operations.

- **`TimeDependentProblem` Trait**:

  - Represents a time-dependent problem, such as a system of ODEs or PDEs.
  - **Associated Types**:
    - `State`: The type representing the state of the system, which must implement the `Vector` trait.
    - `Time`: The type representing time (typically `f64` for real-valued time).
  - **Required Methods**:
    - `fn compute_rhs(&self, time: Self::Time, state: &Self::State, derivative: &mut Self::State) -> Result<(), TimeSteppingError>`:
      - Computes the right-hand side (RHS) of the system at a given time.

      - Performs a single time step.
    - `fn adaptive_step(&mut self, problem: &P, time: P::Time, state: &mut P::State) -> Result<(), TimeSteppingError>`:
      - Performs an adaptive time step, if applicable.
    - `fn set_time_interval(&mut self, start_time: P::Time, end_time: P::Time)`:
