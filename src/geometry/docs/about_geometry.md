### Overview of the `src/geometry/` Module

#### Overview
The `src/geometry/` module in the Hydra project provides essential geometric calculations for 3D shapes used in geophysical fluid dynamics simulations, including prisms, pyramids, hexahedrons, tetrahedrons, and more. This module underpins the finite volume methods (FVM) used to solve partial differential equations across complex domains. The module emphasizes computational efficiency, mathematical rigor, and robustness to handle both regular and degenerate shapes that may arise in realistic simulations.

Key operations in this module include:
- **Centroid Calculation**: Determines the geometric center of various shapes.
- **Volume Computation**: Uses techniques like tetrahedral decomposition for complex shapes.
- **Face Normal Calculation**: Computes outward-pointing normal vectors for face flux calculations.
- **Handling Degenerate Cases**: Manages cases where shapes collapse into lower dimensions.

#### Key Structures and Functions

The primary struct, `Geometry`, encapsulates the geometric data and methods for a mesh, including vertex positions, centroids, volumes, and cached computed properties to avoid redundant calculations.

##### 1. **Centroid Calculation**
Centroid calculations are vital for determining the center of mass of each control volume. These centroids are used as reference points in numerical methods for flux integration, and they enable efficient computation by avoiding repetitive geometric queries.

- **`compute_hexahedron_centroid`**:
    - Calculates the centroid of a hexahedron (e.g., cube or cuboid) by averaging the coordinates of its 8 vertices.
    - This method is optimized for stability and handles both regular and degenerate cases where vertices may collapse onto a plane.
    - **Example Usage**:
      ```rust,ignore
      let geometry = Geometry::new();
      let hexahedron_vertices = vec![
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0, 1.0],
      ];
      let centroid = geometry.compute_hexahedron_centroid(&hexahedron_vertices);
      assert_eq!(centroid, [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]);
      ```

- **`compute_prism_centroid`**:
    - Calculates the centroid of a triangular prism by averaging the centroids of the top and bottom triangular faces.
    - **Example Usage**:
      ```rust,ignore
      let geometry = Geometry::new();
      let prism_vertices = vec![
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0, 1.0],
      ];
      let centroid = geometry.compute_prism_centroid(&prism_vertices);
      assert_eq!(centroid, [1.0 / 3.0, 1.0 / 3.0, 0.5]);
      ```

##### 2. **Volume Calculation**
Volume computation enables the determination of flux through a control volume, which is central to FVM methods. Complex shapes are decomposed into tetrahedrons for efficient and accurate volume computation.

- **`compute_hexahedron_volume`**:
    - Computes the volume of a hexahedron by decomposing it into 5 tetrahedrons and summing their volumes.
    - **Example Usage**:
      ```rust,ignore
      let geometry = Geometry::new();
      let hexahedron_vertices = vec![
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
          [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0, 1.0],
      ];
      let volume = geometry.compute_hexahedron_volume(&hexahedron_vertices);
      assert!((volume - 1.0).abs() < 1e-10);  // Volume of a unit cube
      ```

- **`compute_pyramid_volume`**:
    - Calculates the volume of a square or triangular-based pyramid by breaking down the geometry into tetrahedrons and summing their volumes.
    - **Example Usage**:
      ```rust,ignore
      let geometry = Geometry::new();
      let pyramid_vertices = vec![
          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.5, 0.5, 1.0],
      ];
      let volume = geometry.compute_pyramid_volume(&pyramid_vertices);
      assert!((volume - 1.0 / 3.0).abs() < 1e-10);
      ```

##### 3. **Face Normal Calculation**
Face normal vectors are crucial for FVM, as they define the direction and magnitude of flux through faces. Normal calculations are available for triangular and quadrilateral faces.

- **`compute_triangle_normal`**:
    - Computes the normal vector of a triangle face using the cross product of two edge vectors.
- **`compute_quadrilateral_normal`**:
    - Computes the normal vector of a quadrilateral by dividing it into two triangles and averaging their normals.

##### 4. **Handling Degenerate Cases**
For robustness, the module handles degenerate cases where cells collapse into lower-dimensional shapes. For instance, if a hexahedron collapses into a plane, the volume will be computed as zero, and centroid calculations will default to the average position of the vertices, ensuring stable simulations under various conditions.

- **Example of Degenerate Handling**:
  ```rust,ignore
  let geometry = Geometry::new();
  let degenerate_hexahedron_vertices = vec![
      [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
      [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
  ];
  let volume = geometry.compute_hexahedron_volume(&degenerate_hexahedron_vertices);
  assert_eq!(volume, 0.0);
  ```

### Test Coverage

The module includes rigorous unit testing for all core functions:
- **Regular Shape Tests**: Verifies centroid, volume, and normal calculations for standard shapes like cubes and prisms.
- **Degenerate Shape Tests**: Ensures that the module returns zero volumes for degenerate shapes, handles edge cases in centroid calculations, and tests normals for collapsed faces.

These tests are integral for ensuring numerical stability across a wide range of shapes and configurations.

### Summary

The `src/geometry/` module in Hydra provides fundamental tools for calculating geometric properties within FVM-based simulations. Its capabilities in handling centroids, volumes, and normals for a variety of 3D shapes ensure it can meet the needs of complex geophysical simulations. The moduleâ€™s flexibility and robust handling of degenerate cases make it a reliable foundation for advancing Hydra's mesh handling and simulation processes.
