The `Vector` module in Hydra provides a flexible, thread-safe interface for vector operations essential for Hydra's finite volume method (FVM) in geophysical fluid dynamics.

### 1. Overview

The `Vector` module facilitates mathematical operations critical in the FVM for environmental simulations. It supports both `Vec<f64>` (dense vectors) and `faer::Mat<f64>` (matrix representations treated as vectors) and is thread-safe (`Send` and `Sync`), readying it for parallel processing.

### Key Features

- **Trait-Based Abstraction**: The `Vector` trait provides a consistent interface for both dense vectors and structured data representations.
- **Thread Safety**: All implementations are thread-safe, supporting parallel processing in multi-threaded environments.
- **Core Operations**: Provides essential vector operations like dot products, norms, and element-wise arithmetic, required for iterative methods and stability checks in simulations.
- **Compatibility**: Integrates with Rust’s `Vec<f64>` and `faer` matrix library, enabling scalable data handling across Hydra’s numerical methods.

### Relevance in Hydra

In computational fluid dynamics (CFD), efficient vector operations are vital for handling PDEs and large-scale systems. The `Vector` module supports matrix assembly, boundary condition handling, and iterative solver processes. The modular, trait-based design allows for flexibility and scalability as Hydra evolves.

### 2. Core Components

The `Vector` module, found in `src/linalg/vector`, is structured for clarity and modularity.

#### File Structure

1. **`mod.rs`**: Organizes and re-exports core components.
2. **`traits.rs`**: Defines the `Vector` trait, specifying core vector operations.
3. **`vec_impl.rs`**: Implements `Vector` for `Vec<f64>`, a dense vector representation.
4. **`mat_impl.rs`**: Implements `Vector` for `faer::Mat<f64>`, a matrix used as a column vector.
5. **`tests.rs`**: Contains unit tests to verify method functionality and error handling.

#### Dependencies

- **faer Library**: Supports dense matrix/vector operations.
- **Rust Standard Library**: Supplies `Vec<f64>` and traits for arithmetic and element access.

### 3. `Vector` Trait Documentation

The `Vector` trait defines essential operations that can be implemented for different vector types in Hydra, ensuring compatibility across dense and structured data formats.

#### Trait Methods

1. **`len(&self) -> usize`**: Returns vector length.
2. **`get(&self, i: usize) -> Self::Scalar`**: Retrieves the element at index `i`.
3. **`set(&mut self, i: usize, value: Self::Scalar)`**: Sets the element at index `i` to `value`.
4. **`dot(&self, other: &dyn Vector<Scalar = Self::Scalar>) -> Self::Scalar`**: Computes dot product with another vector.
5. **`norm(&self) -> Self::Scalar`**: Returns the Euclidean norm.
6. **`scale(&mut self, scalar: Self::Scalar)`**: Scales each element by `scalar`.
7. **`axpy(&mut self, a: Self::Scalar, x: &dyn Vector<Scalar = Self::Scalar>)`**: Performs the AXPY operation, `self = a * x + self`.
8. **`cross(&mut self, other: &dyn Vector<Scalar = Self::Scalar>) -> Result<(), &'static str>`**: Computes the cross product (only for 3D vectors).

### 4. Implementations

#### `Vec<f64>` Implementation

The `Vector` trait is implemented for `Vec<f64>`, providing methods for dense vector operations.

```rust
use hydra::linalg::vector::Vector;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut vec: Vec<f64> = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
    vec.scale(2.0); // Doubles each element
    assert_eq!(vec.as_slice(), &[2.0, 4.0, 6.0]);
    Ok(())
}
```

#### `faer::Mat<f64>` Implementation

Implemented for `faer::Mat<f64>` to represent a column vector. Key methods:

- **`len`** returns rows as vector length.
- **`get`, `set`** access and modify elements in column format.
  
```rust
use faer::Mat;
use hydra::linalg::vector::Vector;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create a 3x1 matrix to act as a column vector
    let mut mat = Mat::<f64>::zeros(3, 1);
    
    // Set the first element in the column to 1.0
    mat.write(0, 0, 1.0);
    
    // Get the element at position (0, 0) and check if it is 1.0
    assert_eq!(*mat.get(0, 0), 1.0);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### 5. Testing and Examples

The test suite in `tests.rs` validates both implementations, covering normal operations, edge cases, and concurrent safety.

#### Examples

```rust
use hydra::linalg::vector::Vector;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let vec1 = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
    let vec2 = vec![4.0, 5.0, 6.0];
    assert_eq!(vec1.dot(&vec2), 32.0); // Dot product
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Error Handling

```rust
use hydra::linalg::vector::Vector;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut vec = vec![1.0, 2.0];
    let result = vec.cross(&vec![3.0, 4.0, 5.0]); // Error for non-3D vector
    assert!(result.is_err());
    Ok(())
}
```

### 6. Concurrency and Safety Considerations

All `Vector` trait implementations are `Send` and `Sync`, ensuring thread safety. Methods use Rust’s ownership model for safe concurrent access, allowing Hydra’s vector module to be extended into parallel processing and distributed computing.

### 7. Applications in Hydra

The `Vector` module integrates seamlessly into Hydra’s FVM-based CFD solvers, supporting:

- **Finite Volume Discretization**: Vector operations are used in matrix assembly, boundary flux calculations, and time-stepping.
- **Solver Integration**: Essential in iterative solvers, enabling dot products, norms, and preconditioning for enhanced convergence.
- **Boundary Conditions**: Applied through vector element manipulation, supporting Dirichlet and Neumann conditions.
