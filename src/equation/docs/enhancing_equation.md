To enhance and extend the `Equation` module for solving more complex systems in geophysical fluid dynamics, consider we will focus on several key improvements:

1. **Modular Solver Integration**:
   - Integrate the Krylov subspace methods, particularly GMRES for non-symmetric matrices and Conjugate Gradient (CG) for symmetric matrices, suitable for large-scale sparse systems.
   - Add preconditioner support, like ILU or AMG, to enhance convergence, especially for RANS equations. Reference the iterative method techniques in *Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems*【21†source】for preconditioner details.

2. **Additional Equation Types**:
   - Incorporate more equations beyond continuity and momentum, such as energy and turbulence models (e.g., k-epsilon or LES). These require extensions in the data structures to hold additional state variables like temperature, energy, or turbulent kinetic energy.
   - Develop an interface within `Equation` that allows flexibility in selecting the governing equations based on the physical model required for each simulation.

3. **Advanced Flux Calculation Techniques**:
   - Refine the flux limiter interface in `flux_limiter/flux_limiters.rs` to include additional limiters (e.g., Van Leer, MC, or MUSCL schemes), which are beneficial for handling sharp gradients without introducing oscillations. T.J. Chung’s *Computational Fluid Dynamics*【23†source】covers these methods in detail.

4. **Boundary Condition Expansion**:
   - Extend boundary condition handling to support dynamic conditions such as time-dependent Dirichlet and Neumann conditions, as well as Robin and mixed-type conditions. These may be necessary for simulating natural boundary interactions in lakes and rivers.
   - The `Gradient` module should also be extended to compute gradients accurately near boundaries by adapting to the modified conditions. This will enhance the accuracy of the fluxes at boundaries.

5. **Gradient Calculation Enhancements**:
   - Integrate higher-order gradient calculation methods that go beyond first-order finite differences, potentially improving accuracy for simulations involving steep gradients or discontinuities.
   - Implement options within `gradient_calc.rs` for choosing between central differences, upwind schemes, or other high-resolution methods as discussed in *Computational Fluid Dynamics*【23†source】.

6. **Time-Stepping Integration**:
   - Integrate a time-stepping framework that includes both explicit and implicit schemes, such as Runge-Kutta and Crank-Nicolson. These methods can improve stability and allow for larger time steps when handling stiff equations.
   - Ensure compatibility between time-stepping methods and the modular equation setup, allowing for flexible switching between schemes based on the required accuracy and computational cost.

7. **Documentation and Testing**:
   - As each of these features is developed, add detailed inline documentation and comments explaining each new feature. Develop unit tests for each feature, following a TDD approach to validate both individual functionalities and integration.

These additions will substantially extend the capability of the `Equation` module, aligning it with the complex requirements of environmental fluid simulations. Each modification aligns well with principles from *Rust for Rustaceans*【22†source】and *The Rust Programming Language*【19†source】, ensuring that the module remains performant and idiomatic in Rust.
