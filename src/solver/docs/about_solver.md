## 1. `ksp.rs`

### Functionality

The `ksp.rs` file defines the `KSP` trait and a `SolverResult` struct, forming the foundation for Krylov subspace solvers in HYDRA.

- **`SolverResult` Struct**:

  - **Fields**:

    - `converged: bool`: Indicates whether the solver has successfully converged.
    - `iterations: usize`: The number of iterations performed.
    - `residual_norm: f64`: The norm of the residual at the end of the computation.

- **`KSP` Trait**:

  - Defines a common interface for Krylov subspace solvers, such as Conjugate Gradient (CG) and Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES).

  - **Required Method**:

    - `fn solve(&mut self, a: &dyn Matrix<Scalar = f64>, b: &dyn Vector<Scalar = f64>, x: &mut dyn Vector<Scalar = f64>) -> SolverResult`:

      - Solves the linear system \( Ax = b \) and updates the solution vector `x`.
      - Returns a `SolverResult` indicating convergence status and performance metrics.

### Usage in HYDRA

       - Initializes search direction \( p \) and scalar \( \rho \).

    2. **Iteration Loop**:

       - For each iteration until convergence or reaching `max_iter`:
         - Computes \( q = Ap \).
         - Updates solution vector \( x \) and residual \( r \).
         - Checks for convergence based on the residual norm.
         - Applies preconditioner to the residual.
         - Updates search direction \( p \) and scalar \( \rho \).

    3. **Termination**:

       - Returns a `SolverResult` with convergence status, iterations, and final residual norm.

- **Helper Functions**:
