### Problem Overview: Example 7.2.1 Poisson Equation in CFD (Chung, 2010)

This problem is based on solving the Poisson equation over a 3x2 grid within a unit square domain, subject to specified boundary conditions and internal source terms. The example, found in T.J. Chung's *Computational Fluid Dynamics*, aims to demonstrate numerical solution techniques for the Poisson equation, a widely encountered partial differential equation (PDE) in fluid dynamics, often used to describe potential fields such as temperature or pressure.

The **Poisson equation** in this setup is:

\[
\nabla^2 u = f
\]

where \( u \) is the scalar field (e.g., temperature or potential) we want to solve for, and \( f \) is a source term that varies within the domain. The objective is to use finite difference or finite volume methods to approximate \( u \) at each node in the grid, applying Dirichlet boundary conditions to enforce known values along the boundaries.

### Hydra Framework and Numerical Solution Approach

The **Hydra project** is designed to solve complex geophysical fluid dynamics equations, like the Poisson equation, by implementing the finite volume method (FVM) on unstructured meshes in a computational framework built with Rust. Hydra incorporates components for managing equations, setting up boundary conditions, constructing matrices for numerical methods, and solving sparse linear systems using iterative solvers like GMRES and preconditioners like Jacobi.

The **Equation Module** in Hydra handles the core of the PDE setup:
1. **Mesh and Geometry Representation**: Representing nodes, edges, and faces in the computational domain.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: Applying Dirichlet or Neumann conditions based on provided values.
3. **Source Terms**: Incorporating in-domain source terms directly into the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation matrix.
4. **Solvers**: Using Krylov subspace solvers (e.g., GMRES) with preconditioners to solve large, sparse linear systems arising from discretizing the PDE.

### Detailed Setup for Example 7.2.1

1. **Domain**: A 3x2 unit square grid with 12 nodes.

2. **Boundary and Internal Nodes**:
   - **Dirichlet Boundary Conditions**: The solution \( u \) is specified at boundary nodes based on values derived from the exact analytical solution \( u(x, y) = 2x^2y^2 \).
   - **Exact Solution Nodes**: 
     - \( u_1, u_2, u_3, u_6, u_9, u_{12} = 0 \) (top and bottom edges)
     - \( u_4 = 8 \), \( u_7 = 32 \), \( u_{10} = 72 \), \( u_{11} = 18 \)
   - **Source Terms at Interior Nodes**: 
     - \( f_5 = 8 \) (center node)
     - \( f_8 = 20 \) (adjacent center node)

3. **Numerical Discretization**:
   - Using a finite volume approach, each node in the mesh is represented by an equation expressing the balance of fluxes at that node.
   - The source terms \( f \) and boundary conditions are incorporated into the RHS vector \( b \), which drives the solution within the interior nodes.

4. **Linear System**:
   - The resulting system \( A x = b \), where \( A \) is the matrix representation of the Poisson operator with finite difference approximations, \( x \) is the vector of unknowns (nodal values of \( u \)), and \( b \) includes the source terms and boundary conditions.
   - The sparse matrix \( A \) is generated by defining relationships between nodes based on grid connectivity and discretization.

5. **Solvers and Convergence**:
   - GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual Method) is used to solve the system because of its robustness with non-symmetric systems and iterative convergence potential in sparse systems.
   - Jacobi preconditioning is applied to improve convergence by reducing the effective condition number of \( A \).
   - Convergence criteria are based on a residual norm threshold (e.g., \( 1e-6 \)) to ensure sufficient accuracy in the numerical solution.

### Challenges with Convergence

In this problem setup, **convergence issues** are observed, likely due to:
- **Matrix Conditioning**: The Poisson matrix for this setup may be poorly conditioned, especially with mixed boundary and source terms that can exacerbate numerical instability.
- **Boundary Conditions Impacting Internal Nodes**: Dirichlet conditions on boundaries strongly affect internal node values, which may be sensitive to slight changes in matrix structure or RHS values.
- **Finite Volume vs. Finite Difference**: Ensuring consistent finite volume discretization on a structured grid can introduce challenges compared to finite difference schemes, particularly in boundary region handling.

### Key Points for Problem Reproducibility

To accurately reproduce and potentially address convergence, it's important to:
1. **Accurately Implement the Mesh** as a structured grid matching the 3x2 setup.
2. **Set Exact Boundary Conditions and Source Terms** as specified in the example.
3. **Ensure Matrix Construction Reflects Poisson Characteristics**: Verify that the discretized matrix \( A \) properly reflects the finite volume or finite difference scheme applied to the Poisson equation.
4. **Adjust Solver Parameters**: Increase iteration count, test alternative preconditioners, or refine convergence criteria as needed.

Hydraâ€™s modular approach, with clearly defined interfaces for boundary conditions, matrix construction, and solver management, allows flexibility in testing different configurations and methods to potentially achieve convergence in challenging setups like this.
