## Section 1: Mesh Handling and Data Structure Design

The HYDRA project aims to develop robust and flexible mesh-handling methodologies to support complex geometrical configurations in the Finite Volume Method (FVM) for fluid dynamics. This section outlines our design philosophy and data structure, with a particular focus on efficient interaction between mesh topology, solver requirements, and scalability for parallel computation. 

### 1.1 Introduction to Mesh Structures in PDE Solvers

Finite volume solvers for environmental fluid dynamics often necessitate highly structured mesh handling to efficiently represent geometrically complex domains, such as riverbeds and reservoir contours. Traditional data structures separate mesh topology from associated PDE data, leading to difficulties when extending functionality, especially in parallel computation. Here, we adopt a generalized approach inspired by the **Sieve** framework (Knepley & Karpeev, 2009), which emphasizes three core principles:
1. **Locality and Independence**: Data structures are organized around mesh elements (cells, faces, vertices) rather than relying on global indexing.
2. **Duality of Operations**: Topological operations on the mesh are dual to data operations, allowing for intuitive traversal and manipulation of mesh-embedded data.
3. **Flexible Overlaps for Parallelism**: Subdomains are defined by overlaps, enabling the seamless partitioning and redistribution necessary for parallel computation.

### 1.2 Data Structure Design

Following Sieve's methodology, our mesh data structure leverages **arrows** (incidence relations) as fundamental entities to encode relationships between mesh points (vertices, edges, faces). This "arrow-centric" approach facilitates:
- **Dimension-independent programming**: Operations like "restriction" to a cell’s local neighborhood and "extension" across adjacent cells are handled identically, irrespective of mesh dimension or shape.
- **Efficient locality-based traversal**: Geometric operations (e.g., finding a cell’s boundary or neighboring cells) are based on arrows, simplifying code reuse and reducing reliance on global indexing.

### 1.3 Overlapping Domains and Distributed Meshes

To support parallelism, HYDRA utilizes an overlap-based structure for defining local subdomains. Each subdomain maintains its mesh topology and geometry, interconnected by **overlap arrows** that define point relations across subdomains. Inspired by the Sieve model, each partitioned mesh can be easily synchronized via these overlaps, enabling:
- **Independent subdomain processing**: Each subdomain may operate independently, with inter-partition arrows facilitating data consistency.
- **Seamless mesh distribution**: The use of local Sieve representations and consistent overlap relations enables distributed mesh operations without dimension-specific alterations.

### 1.4 Integration with the Solver

The HYDRA project utilizes a solver structure where fields (e.g., velocity, pressure) are mapped directly to mesh elements via **sections**. These sections, akin to Sieve's "Map" structure, support restriction and extension operations that map directly onto mesh operations, providing:
- **Unified data access**: Fields associated with mesh points are accessed and manipulated using a coherent interface that extends naturally across subdomain boundaries.
- **Data localization**: Each field’s values are associated directly with the relevant mesh points, allowing the solver to retrieve and process data with minimal overhead.
  
By aligning our data structure with these principles, HYDRA’s mesh handling is designed to offer flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in supporting large-scale, parallel finite volume computations across complex domains.

The `sieve.rs` module provides the core structure for managing relationships between mesh entities. This relationship structure, modeled on the Sieve framework, efficiently organizes and queries adjacency relationships between `MeshEntity` objects (such as vertices, edges, faces, and cells) using a directed graph of **arrows**. By using Sieve, we enable HYDRA to maintain local and global entity relationships with minimal reliance on global ordering, which is particularly beneficial in parallel and distributed contexts.

The `Sieve` struct utilizes an adjacency map (`DashMap`) to handle the interactions between entities and provides an interface for computing complex topological queries. This struct allows for flexibility in traversing, querying, and modifying relationships, supporting functions for cones, closures, stars, and supports for entities, as well as union and intersection operations essential for mesh refinement and connectivity analysis.
