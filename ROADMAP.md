# updated progress and next steps

## 1. geometry handling (`geometry.rs` and its modules)

we have successfully made significant strides in the geometry handling module, specifically targeting the representation and computation of centroids and volumes for various 3d mesh elements, such as tetrahedrons, prisms, pyramids, and hexahedrons. these elements are critical in defining complex unstructured meshes and setting the groundwork for computational operations such as finite volume methods (fvm) and finite element methods (fem).

### key accomplishments:

- **basic geometry handling module (`geometry.rs`)**:
  - we structured geometric operations around various 3d shapes (tetrahedrons, hexahedrons, prisms, pyramids).
  - computation of centroids and volumes for each shape has been implemented using both analytical methods and numerical methods (e.g., splitting pyramids into tetrahedrons for more accurate volume and centroid calculations).

- **shape-specific modules**:
  - each 3d shape (e.g., `tetrahedron.rs`, `pyramid.rs`, etc.) contains:
    - functions to compute centroid and volume.
    - methods to divide complex elements (e.g., splitting pyramids into tetrahedrons).
  - robust unit tests ensure the correctness of these calculations, though further adjustments and debugging are required in edge cases (like degenerate shapes).

- **testing and debugging**:
  - extensive testing helped identify failures in pyramid centroid and volume calculations. these were traced back to improper weighting and centroid calculations, particularly in degenerate cases.
  - a numerical approach was adopted to split shapes into simpler sub-elements (e.g., tetrahedrons) for more reliable calculations.

## 2. mesh entity management and sieve data structure

previous work on managing mesh entities and defining relationships between these entities has been solidified. specifically:

- mesh entities such as vertices, edges, faces, and cells are organized using a combination of enums and arrows (incidence relationships between entities).
- the sieve data structure effectively handles hierarchical relationships between mesh entities, forming the core of the topological operations on the mesh.

### core operations:

- `cone`, `closure`, `support`, and `star` operations: capture the hierarchical and topological relationships between mesh entities. these are critical for pde solvers that require efficient access to neighboring or related entities in the mesh.
- `meet` and `join`: these operations handle minimal separators for closures and stars, which are particularly useful in stratified meshes.

## 3. section data management (`section.rs`)

the section structure was implemented to allow association of data (e.g., vertex coordinates, element values) with mesh entities. this will be expanded as geometry handling is further refined.

### key functionality:

- `set`, `restrict`, and `update` data: functions that allow associating, retrieving, and updating data related to specific entities.
- efficient storage: data is stored in contiguous arrays for better performance, especially when dealing with large meshes.

## 4. reordering and stratification

to enhance memory locality and solver performance, we have implemented:

- **cuthill-mckee algorithm** for reordering mesh entities.
- **stratification** of entities by dimension (e.g., vertices, edges, faces), allowing optimized processing for different solver techniques.

## 5. overlap and parallelism

we designed the overlap structure to manage distributed meshes, supporting local and ghost entities. this is critical for parallel computation in large-scale simulations:

- **delta structures** store transformation data and ensure consistency across partitions.

## 6. unit tests and validation

### progress in testing and validation:

- unit tests have been written for the geometry module (prisms, tetrahedrons, pyramids, etc.) and for other modules (e.g., sieve, reordering, section).
- debugging and adjustments continue in edge cases, particularly for degenerate geometries.

## 7. updated next steps

### immediate priorities:

- **finalizing geometry handling**:
  - complete debugging of pyramid centroid and volume calculations to handle edge cases more robustly.
  - implement optimized methods for handling prisms and hexahedrons using the divergence theorem or similar analytical methods for efficiency.

- **boundary conditions**:
  - develop modules to handle boundary conditions (e.g., dirichlet, neumann). these will interact with the `section.rs` structure to allow for boundary-specific data association.

- **solver integration**:
  - begin integrating the mesh infrastructure with pde solvers (e.g., petscâ€™s `dmplex`).
  - develop the interface between geometry handling and linear system assembly for fem or fvm solvers.

### longer-term objectives:

- **performance optimization**:
  - profiling of key areas such as adjacency lookups, reordering algorithms, and mesh partitioning should be prioritized to ensure scalability.

- **parallelization**:
  - leverage mpi or other parallelization frameworks in conjunction with the overlap structure for distributed mesh handling.

- **documentation**:
  - continue to expand in-line documentation for each module. this will ensure clear usage and facilitate future maintenance.
  - create a user guide with examples of mesh creation, data association, and geometry computations.

- **comprehensive testing**:
  - develop integration tests that combine multiple components of the system (e.g., sieve + section + overlap) to ensure everything works together as expected in real-world scenarios.

## 8. challenges and focus areas

- **parallelization and performance**: managing data consistency and efficiency at scale will be key challenges as we move into solver integration and larger meshes.
- **handling complex geometries**: ensuring that degenerate and complex shapes (e.g., concave polyhedrons) are handled efficiently is a focus for the geometry module.

by continuing to focus on these areas, we will develop a robust, scalable, and efficient framework for unstructured mesh management and computation.
