<h4 id="1-module-overview"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#1-module-overview">§</a>1. Module Overview</h4>
<p>The <code>Boundary</code> module in this project is responsible for defining and applying boundary conditions to mesh entities within the computational domain. Boundary conditions play a crucial role in numerical simulations for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as they define how the flow interacts with the boundaries of the domain, such as walls, inlets, or outlets. This module ensures that boundary conditions are consistently and accurately applied to entities in a boundary-fitted 3D mesh, influencing the system matrices and right-hand side (RHS) vectors used in finite volume method (FVM) solvers.</p>
<p>The <code>Boundary</code> module provides a robust and flexible interface for managing boundary conditions, making it straightforward to add, retrieve, and apply boundary conditions to mesh entities. The modular design of this boundary condition system also allows for easy extension, enabling developers to add new types of boundary conditions as the project evolves.</p>
<h5 id="11-components-of-the-boundary-module"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#11-components-of-the-boundary-module">§</a>1.1 Components of the Boundary Module</h5>
<p>The <code>Boundary</code> module consists of four main components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Boundary Condition Types</strong>: Defined as variants in the <code>BoundaryCondition</code> enum, these represent the types of boundary conditions commonly used in CFD, such as Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions.</li>
<li><strong>BoundaryConditionHandler</strong>: A management structure that associates specific boundary conditions with mesh entities in the domain.</li>
<li><strong>BoundaryConditionApply</strong>: A trait that provides a standardized <code>apply</code> interface, allowing all boundary condition types to be applied uniformly to mesh entities.</li>
<li><strong>Dedicated Modules for Each Condition</strong>: Submodules (<code>dirichlet.rs</code>, <code>neumann.rs</code>, <code>robin.rs</code>) contain the specific logic for applying each boundary condition type, ensuring that boundary-specific modifications to matrices and RHS vectors are encapsulated within each respective module.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="12-summary-of-key-boundary-condition-types"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#12-summary-of-key-boundary-condition-types">§</a>1.2 Summary of Key Boundary Condition Types</h5>
<p>Boundary conditions are formulated in terms of the common types used in fluid dynamics and are applied through the <code>BoundaryCondition</code> enum:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dirichlet Condition</strong>: Specifies a fixed value for a solution variable (e.g., temperature or pressure) at a boundary node. This is useful for simulations where a boundary variable is known, such as a constant temperature at a heated wall.</li>
<li><strong>Neumann Condition</strong>: Specifies the gradient or flux of a solution variable at a boundary, impacting only the RHS vector without modifying the system matrix. Neumann conditions are often used in situations with known fluxes, such as fluid outflow.</li>
<li><strong>Robin Condition</strong>: Combines Dirichlet and Neumann conditions as a linear equation involving both the value and gradient of the variable. This is especially useful in cases like heat transfer across a boundary with convective effects.</li>
<li><strong>Functional Variants</strong>: Functional forms of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions enable dynamic or spatially varying conditions, useful for time-dependent or position-based boundary specifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>The design of this module allows for these boundary conditions to be applied either as static values or as functions of time and position, making the system adaptable to a range of physical scenarios in geophysical fluid dynamics. Each condition type has a corresponding implementation that modifies the system matrix and/or RHS vector according to the specific mathematical requirements of the condition.</p>
<h5 id="13-benefits-of-modular-structure"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#13-benefits-of-modular-structure">§</a>1.3 Benefits of Modular Structure</h5>
<p>The modular structure of the <code>Boundary</code> module provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Each boundary condition type has its own dedicated handler, allowing the module to scale with additional boundary conditions as they are introduced. New conditions can be implemented independently without modifying the existing structure.</li>
<li><strong>Code Reusability and Maintenance</strong>: By encapsulating each boundary condition type in its own module, the module promotes separation of concerns and makes each boundary condition handler independent. This modularization eases maintenance and debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Future Parallelization Support</strong>: Since boundary conditions are stored using concurrent structures (<code>DashMap</code>), this design is conscious of future parallel execution. Conditions can be set and retrieved by multiple threads without requiring extensive restructuring of the module.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="14-integration-with-domain-and-solver-modules"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#14-integration-with-domain-and-solver-modules">§</a>1.4 Integration with Domain and Solver Modules</h5>
<p>The <code>Boundary</code> module interfaces directly with the <code>Domain</code> module by using the <code>MeshEntity</code> objects that represent the domain’s mesh. <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> associates these mesh entities with specific boundary conditions, enabling consistent boundary condition applications across the mesh. When the solver constructs system matrices, the <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> ensures that these boundary conditions are appropriately reflected in the matrices and RHS vectors, thus maintaining the integrity of the simulation.</p>
<h5 id="15-summary"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#15-summary">§</a>1.5 Summary</h5>
<p>The <code>Boundary</code> module is an integral part of the simulation workflow, providing a flexible and extensible framework for defining and applying boundary conditions. By managing boundary conditions in a consistent and efficient manner, this module ensures that the physical interactions at domain boundaries are faithfully represented, allowing for accurate and stable CFD simulations. This modular approach, with distinct submodules for each boundary condition type, ensures that the system is easy to maintain and extend, while being highly adaptable to a range of simulation scenarios and requirements.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="2-core-components"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#2-core-components">§</a>2. Core Components</h4>
<p>The <code>Boundary</code> module comprises several interdependent components that define, manage, and apply boundary conditions. These core components collectively enable the flexible application of boundary conditions to entities within the computational domain, which is essential for accurately simulating fluid dynamics scenarios using finite volume methods (FVM).</p>
<h5 id="21-boundary-condition-types"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#21-boundary-condition-types">§</a>2.1 Boundary Condition Types</h5>
<p>At the heart of the <code>Boundary</code> module is the <code>BoundaryCondition</code> enum, which defines the types of boundary conditions that can be applied. Each boundary condition type corresponds to specific physical conditions at the boundary of the computational domain. These types are directly tied to the mathematical formulations of boundary conditions in fluid dynamics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dirichlet Condition</strong>: Represents a fixed value for a variable on the boundary. Commonly used to specify known values for temperature, pressure, or velocity at a boundary node. This condition type impacts both the system matrix and the RHS vector by fixing the value of the variable at the boundary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neumann Condition</strong>: Represents a specified flux or gradient at the boundary. This condition modifies only the RHS vector, as it adjusts the flux without altering the variable’s value at the boundary node itself. Neumann conditions are particularly useful for situations where the derivative of a variable, such as a heat flux or fluid outflow, is known.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Robin Condition</strong>: Represents a linear combination of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions. This condition combines a fixed boundary value (Dirichlet) with a specified flux or gradient (Neumann), utilizing two parameters, <code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code>. Robin conditions are common in scenarios like convective heat transfer, where both the temperature and its gradient impact boundary behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functional Variants</strong>: Function-based forms of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions enable the use of boundary conditions that vary over time or depend on position. These dynamic conditions allow for a broader range of simulations, including time-varying inflow conditions or boundary temperatures that change with spatial coordinates. Functional variants are defined as closures, which can take in time and coordinate values, allowing for maximum flexibility in boundary behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these boundary condition types has a dedicated handler in its respective submodule (<code>dirichlet.rs</code>, <code>neumann.rs</code>, and <code>robin.rs</code>), encapsulating the logic for how each type impacts the system matrices and RHS vectors.</p>
<h5 id="22-boundaryconditionhandler"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#22-boundaryconditionhandler">§</a>2.2 BoundaryConditionHandler</h5>
<p>The <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> struct manages the association between mesh entities and boundary conditions. Using a concurrent <code>DashMap</code> data structure, it enables safe and efficient storage, retrieval, and updating of boundary conditions in a way that supports parallel access and thread-safe modification.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Initialization</strong>: The <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> is initialized with an empty <code>DashMap</code>, setting up a storage structure to hold boundary conditions linked to specific mesh entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting Boundary Conditions</strong>: <code>set_bc</code> is a method that associates a <code>BoundaryCondition</code> with a specific <code>MeshEntity</code>. This association is crucial for ensuring that the correct boundary condition is applied to each entity in the computational domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retrieving Boundary Conditions</strong>: <code>get_bc</code> allows for retrieval of the boundary condition associated with a given mesh entity. This method returns an <code>Option&lt;BoundaryCondition&gt;</code> to handle cases where a boundary condition may not be set for an entity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Applying Boundary Conditions</strong>: <code>apply_bc</code> is the core method of <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code>, responsible for modifying the system matrix and RHS vector to reflect the boundary conditions applied to specific entities. During this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>The method iterates over <code>boundary_entities</code> and uses the <code>entity_to_index</code> mapping (a <code>DashMap</code> of <code>MeshEntity</code> to matrix indices) to identify the corresponding position in the system matrices.</li>
<li>For each entity with a boundary condition, it invokes the appropriate method for modifying the matrix and/or RHS, ensuring that the boundary condition (Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin) is accurately represented in the system equations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through <code>apply_bc</code>, <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> ensures that each boundary condition is translated into the system matrices according to its mathematical representation, maintaining the fidelity of the simulation.</p>
<h5 id="23-boundaryconditionapply-trait"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#23-boundaryconditionapply-trait">§</a>2.3 BoundaryConditionApply Trait</h5>
<p>The <code>BoundaryConditionApply</code> trait provides a standardized interface for applying boundary conditions, defining an <code>apply</code> method that all boundary condition types can implement. This trait enhances modularity by enabling each boundary condition type to handle its specific matrix and RHS modifications independently.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: <code>BoundaryConditionApply</code> establishes a generic interface for applying boundary conditions, supporting both concrete conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin) and functional forms (DirichletFn, NeumannFn). This interface enables consistent handling of boundary applications while allowing for specific variations in application methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implementations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each type within the <code>BoundaryCondition</code> enum implements <code>BoundaryConditionApply</code>, meaning that conditions like Dirichlet and Neumann can each define their specific application logic.</li>
<li>Submodules for each boundary type (<code>dirichlet.rs</code>, <code>neumann.rs</code>, <code>robin.rs</code>) further implement this trait for specific operations, ensuring separation of logic by boundary type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Execution Flow</strong>: When the <code>apply</code> method is called on a <code>BoundaryCondition</code>, it identifies the boundary condition type and performs the necessary operations on the system matrix and RHS. This pattern abstracts the application details from the main solver, centralizing boundary condition logic within the <code>Boundary</code> module.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By providing a uniform application interface, the <code>BoundaryConditionApply</code> trait simplifies the process of integrating boundary conditions within the solver, enabling new condition types to be added seamlessly and applied through the same interface.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="3-boundary-condition-types"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#3-boundary-condition-types">§</a>3. Boundary Condition Types</h4>
<p>The <code>Boundary</code> module supports three primary boundary condition types — <code>Dirichlet</code>, <code>Neumann</code>, and <code>Robin</code> — each encapsulated within its dedicated submodule and each critical to various simulation scenarios in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These boundary conditions impact the system matrices and right-hand side (RHS) vector, dictating how physical variables like velocity, pressure, or temperature behave at the boundaries of the computational domain. Additionally, functional variants of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions allow for dynamic boundary conditions that depend on time or spatial coordinates.</p>
<h5 id="31-dirichlet-boundary-condition-dirichletrs"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#31-dirichlet-boundary-condition-dirichletrs">§</a>3.1 Dirichlet Boundary Condition (<code>dirichlet.rs</code>)</h5>
<p>A Dirichlet boundary condition fixes the value of a variable at the boundary, specifying exact values for solution variables such as temperature or pressure. This type of condition is frequently used to represent physical boundaries with known values, such as walls with fixed temperatures or inflows with specified velocities. The Dirichlet boundary condition affects both the system matrix and the RHS vector to enforce these fixed values.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Structure</strong>: The <code>DirichletBC</code> struct handles the application of Dirichlet conditions, using a <code>DashMap</code> to associate mesh entities with their boundary values.</li>
<li><strong>Core Methods</strong>:
<ul>
<li><code>set_bc</code>: Associates a <code>BoundaryCondition::Dirichlet</code> value with a mesh entity, storing it in the internal map for later application.</li>
<li><code>apply_bc</code>: Applies all stored Dirichlet conditions to the matrix and RHS, iterating over each condition to apply either constant or function-based values.</li>
<li><code>apply_constant_dirichlet</code>: Modifies the matrix and RHS for a specific entity, setting the matrix row to zero except on the diagonal and updating the RHS to match the boundary value. This transformation effectively enforces the fixed Dirichlet value for the corresponding variable at the boundary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Functional Variant (DirichletFn)</strong>: In cases where the boundary value changes over time or space, <code>BoundaryCondition::DirichletFn</code> allows for a dynamic specification of the boundary condition. This functional variant accepts a closure that takes time and coordinate inputs, making it ideal for time-varying or position-dependent boundary conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Dirichlet boundary condition is enforced by fixing matrix elements in a way that overrides any influences from neighboring cells, effectively locking the solution at the specified boundary value.</p>
<h5 id="32-neumann-boundary-condition-neumannrs"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#32-neumann-boundary-condition-neumannrs">§</a>3.2 Neumann Boundary Condition (<code>neumann.rs</code>)</h5>
<p>A Neumann boundary condition specifies the gradient or flux of a variable across the boundary, modifying only the RHS vector without impacting the system matrix. This type of condition is essential in scenarios where the derivative of a variable is known rather than the variable itself, such as specifying heat flux across a boundary or fluid outflow rates. Neumann conditions are often used to model open boundaries or flow across a permeable surface.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Structure</strong>: The <code>NeumannBC</code> struct manages Neumann conditions, using a <code>DashMap</code> to store each condition associated with a mesh entity.</li>
<li><strong>Core Methods</strong>:
<ul>
<li><code>set_bc</code>: Stores a <code>BoundaryCondition::Neumann</code> value for a specified mesh entity.</li>
<li><code>apply_bc</code>: Applies all stored Neumann conditions to the RHS vector, iterating over each entry and applying either a constant flux or a function-based Neumann value.</li>
<li><code>apply_constant_neumann</code>: Adds the specified flux value to the RHS vector for the boundary entity’s index, adjusting the RHS without altering the matrix.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Functional Variant (NeumannFn)</strong>: For dynamic boundary fluxes that vary over time or spatial position, <code>BoundaryCondition::NeumannFn</code> allows for function-based Neumann conditions. This approach enables the specification of flux values as functions of time and coordinates, allowing the boundary condition to reflect more complex or transient physical scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, the Neumann boundary condition is applied by modifying only the RHS vector, which maintains the continuity of the flux while leaving the variable value unconstrained at the boundary.</p>
<h5 id="33-robin-boundary-condition-robinrs"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#33-robin-boundary-condition-robinrs">§</a>3.3 Robin Boundary Condition (<code>robin.rs</code>)</h5>
<p>A Robin boundary condition is a linear combination of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions, often expressed as [ \alpha u + \beta \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = g ]. This type of condition is useful for scenarios such as convective heat transfer, where the boundary’s behavior depends on both the variable value and its gradient. Robin conditions impact both the system matrix and RHS vector to enforce this combination of fixed and flux-based behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Structure</strong>: The <code>RobinBC</code> struct represents Robin conditions, with a <code>DashMap</code> that maps mesh entities to their corresponding <code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code> parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Core Methods</strong>:
<ul>
<li><code>set_bc</code>: Associates a <code>BoundaryCondition::Robin</code> (with parameters <code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code>) with a specific mesh entity.</li>
<li><code>apply_bc</code>: Iterates over all stored Robin conditions and applies them to both the system matrix and RHS vector for each boundary entity. The function adjusts the system matrix based on <code>alpha</code> and updates the RHS using <code>beta</code>.</li>
<li><code>apply_robin</code>: Directly modifies the matrix and RHS by adding <code>alpha</code> to the matrix diagonal entry and adjusting the RHS with <code>beta</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Robin boundary condition is ideal for situations where the boundary exhibits convective behavior, such as cooling or heating by an ambient environment. By adjusting both the matrix and RHS, the Robin condition provides a flexible, linear boundary interaction.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="34-summary-of-boundary-condition-types"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#34-summary-of-boundary-condition-types">§</a>3.4 Summary of Boundary Condition Types</h4>
<p>Each boundary condition type is implemented in its dedicated submodule, with specific logic encapsulated in methods that update the system matrix and RHS vector according to the mathematical representation of the boundary condition. The design is flexible enough to support functional variants, allowing boundary values and fluxes to vary with time or position, which is particularly valuable for dynamic simulations.</p>
<p>By using an enum (<code>BoundaryCondition</code>) and a trait (<code>BoundaryConditionApply</code>), the <code>Boundary</code> module supports both consistent application logic and extension to new boundary condition types as the project evolves. This structured and scalable approach ensures accurate representation of physical boundary conditions, a critical factor for realistic simulations in environmental fluid dynamics.
Here is the complete text for <strong>Section 4: BoundaryConditionHandler</strong>:</p>

<h4 id="4-boundaryconditionhandler"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#4-boundaryconditionhandler">§</a>4. BoundaryConditionHandler</h4>
<p>The <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> struct is a central component of the <code>Boundary</code> module, responsible for managing and applying boundary conditions to mesh entities in the computational domain. It acts as a repository and interface for setting, retrieving, and applying boundary conditions across entities, ensuring consistent boundary application for fluid dynamics simulations. By using <code>DashMap</code> for concurrent access, <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> is built with parallelism in mind, allowing for future scalability.</p>
<h5 id="41-structure-and-initialization"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#41-structure-and-initialization">§</a>4.1 Structure and Initialization</h5>
<p>The <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> struct is defined with a <code>DashMap</code> that associates <code>MeshEntity</code> objects with their corresponding <code>BoundaryCondition</code> entries:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DashMap&lt;MeshEntity, BoundaryCondition&gt;</code>: This concurrent map allows for safe, parallel access to boundary conditions, ensuring that multiple threads can query or modify conditions without introducing data race conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose of DashMap</strong>: This choice of data structure enables efficient access and modification, supporting both single-threaded and parallel applications of boundary conditions across mesh entities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The handler is initialized with an empty map through its <code>new</code> method:</p>

<div class="example-wrap ignore"><a href="#" class="tooltip" title="This example is not tested">ⓘ</a><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">pub fn </span>new() -&gt; <span class="self">Self </span>{

<p>This method creates a new, empty <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> instance, ready to store boundary conditions for mesh entities.</p>

<p>The <code>BoundaryConditionApply</code> trait is implemented for each variant of the <code>BoundaryCondition</code> enum, allowing for a customized application process depending on the boundary type:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Dirichlet Condition Implementation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>apply</code> method for <code>BoundaryCondition::Dirichlet</code> modifies both the system matrix and RHS to set the boundary value at the specified index.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Sets the matrix row to zero except for the diagonal entry, which is set to 1.</li>
<li>Sets the RHS entry to the Dirichlet value, enforcing the fixed boundary condition at this location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neumann Condition Implementation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>apply</code> method for <code>BoundaryCondition::Neumann</code> modifies only the RHS vector by adding the flux value, representing the specified gradient at the boundary without altering the matrix.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Adjusts the RHS vector at the given index to reflect the Neumann flux. This modification allows the solver to account for the flux without fixing the variable’s value at the boundary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Robin Condition Implementation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>apply</code> method for <code>BoundaryCondition::Robin</code> adjusts both the matrix and RHS, combining the effects of a Dirichlet and Neumann condition.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Updates the matrix diagonal entry by adding the <code>alpha</code> parameter.</li>
<li>Adds <code>beta</code> to the RHS at the corresponding index, ensuring that the Robin condition’s linear combination is enforced in the system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Function-Based Conditions (DirichletFn and NeumannFn)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DirichletFn</strong>: For time- or space-dependent Dirichlet conditions, the <code>apply</code> method evaluates the function with the current time and coordinates, then applies it similarly to a standard Dirichlet condition by modifying both the matrix and RHS.</li>
<li><strong>NeumannFn</strong>: For dynamic Neumann conditions, the function is evaluated, and the result is added to the RHS at the appropriate index, just like a constant Neumann condition.</li>
<li><strong>Usage of <code>time</code> and Coordinates</strong>: The coordinates for each entity are currently represented by a placeholder, allowing future expansion for spatially-dependent boundary conditions once the system includes entity-specific coordinates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These implementations enable the flexible application of both static and dynamic boundary conditions, allowing for customized boundary treatments that vary over time or space.</p>
<h5 id="54-example-usage-in-solver-workflow"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#54-example-usage-in-solver-workflow">§</a>5.4 Example Usage in Solver Workflow</h5>
<p>During the setup or time-stepping phases in a solver, the <code>apply</code> method of <code>BoundaryConditionApply</code> is invoked for each boundary condition. This approach allows the solver to dynamically apply conditions across boundary entities based on the current simulation state.</p>
<p>For instance, when applying boundary conditions for a Dirichlet boundary at time ( t ), the solver will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve the entity-to-index mapping to locate the matrix and RHS entries for each boundary entity.</li>
<li>Call the <code>apply</code> method for each boundary condition, letting the specific condition type modify the matrix and RHS as required.</li>
<li>Repeat this process at each time step, with function-based boundary conditions recalculating values as time evolves.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workflow ensures that the boundary conditions are continuously enforced, maintaining the physical accuracy of boundary interactions in the simulation.</p>
<h5 id="55-summary-of-boundaryconditionapply-benefits"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#55-summary-of-boundaryconditionapply-benefits">§</a>5.5 Summary of BoundaryConditionApply Benefits</h5>
<p>The <code>BoundaryConditionApply</code> trait provides a standardized, extensible framework for applying boundary conditions in a CFD simulation:</p>

<hr />
<h4 id="6-integration-with-domain-and-solver-modules"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#6-integration-with-domain-and-solver-modules">§</a>6. Integration with Domain and Solver Modules</h4>
<p>The <code>Boundary</code> module is designed to integrate seamlessly with the <code>Domain</code> and <code>Solver</code> modules, ensuring that boundary conditions are applied consistently across the mesh entities in a computational domain and correctly incorporated into the system matrices and right-hand side (RHS) vector within the solver. This integration is essential for achieving physically accurate results in simulations of fluid dynamics, where boundary conditions often define critical behaviors like inflow, outflow, or no-slip conditions at the domain’s boundaries.</p>
<h5 id="61-interaction-with-the-domain-module"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#61-interaction-with-the-domain-module">§</a>6.1 Interaction with the Domain Module</h5>
<p>The <code>Boundary</code> module interacts closely with the <code>Domain</code> module through its use of <code>MeshEntity</code> objects, which represent the vertices, edges, or faces within the mesh that require boundary conditions. The <code>Domain</code> module provides the structure and organization of the computational mesh, defining the geometric and topological relationships among entities, which are then used by the <code>Boundary</code> module to associate boundary conditions with specific parts of the domain.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mesh Entities</strong>: <code>MeshEntity</code> objects are the fundamental units of the mesh within the <code>Domain</code> module. These entities serve as the points of application for boundary conditions, allowing the <code>Boundary</code> module to specify and enforce boundary values, fluxes, or gradients on the appropriate locations within the mesh.</li>
<li><strong>Entity Mapping</strong>: The <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> utilizes a mapping (<code>entity_to_index</code>) that links each <code>MeshEntity</code> to its corresponding index in the matrix and RHS vector. This mapping is typically managed by the <code>Domain</code> module and enables direct access to the matrix and RHS entries that need modification, streamlining the application of boundary conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Boundary Entities List</strong>: The <code>Domain</code> module maintains a list of <code>boundary_entities</code> that identifies which mesh entities are located on the boundary. This list is passed to the <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> during the application phase, ensuring that only boundary-specific conditions are applied, preserving computational efficiency and accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The interaction between the <code>Domain</code> and <code>Boundary</code> modules allows boundary conditions to be spatially targeted, ensuring that each boundary entity receives the appropriate condition type (e.g., Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin) according to its position and role within the domain.</p>
<h5 id="62-application-in-the-solver-module"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#62-application-in-the-solver-module">§</a>6.2 Application in the Solver Module</h5>
<p>Within the solver workflow, the <code>Boundary</code> module’s functionality is invoked to modify the system matrix and RHS vector prior to solving the equations at each time step (for time-dependent simulations) or iteration (for steady-state simulations). This integration allows the solver to account for the effects of boundary conditions, ensuring that the final solution accurately reflects the physical interactions at the domain boundaries.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System Matrix and RHS Modification</strong>: The <code>apply_bc</code> method in <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> is called within the solver setup phase, modifying both the system matrix and RHS vector based on the specified boundary conditions. This step is critical for enforcing boundary values, fluxes, or gradients directly in the numerical solution.</li>
<li><strong>Time-Dependent Boundary Conditions</strong>: For simulations with time-varying boundaries, function-based boundary conditions (e.g., <code>DirichletFn</code> and <code>NeumannFn</code>) depend on the current time, allowing dynamic boundary behavior. The solver provides the current time as an argument to the <code>apply_bc</code> method, enabling the evaluation of these function-based conditions at each time step.</li>
<li><strong>Entity-to-Index Mapping</strong>: The solver maintains or accesses the <code>entity_to_index</code> mapping from the <code>Domain</code> module, allowing it to accurately locate the matrix and RHS indices associated with each boundary entity. This mapping ensures that the boundary conditions are applied at the correct matrix locations, avoiding inconsistencies and errors in the solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>The integration of boundary conditions within the solver workflow ensures that all physical constraints imposed by boundaries are reflected in the system equations, enhancing the realism and stability of the simulation results.</p>
<h5 id="63-workflow-example"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#63-workflow-example">§</a>6.3 Workflow Example</h5>
<p>In practice, the application of boundary conditions within a solver follows a structured workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup Phase</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Domain</code> module identifies all mesh entities on the boundary and provides the <code>boundary_entities</code> list and <code>entity_to_index</code> mapping.</li>
<li>The <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> receives the boundary entities and assigns appropriate boundary conditions to each entity through <code>set_bc</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application Phase</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>At each time step or iteration, the solver calls <code>apply_bc</code> from <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code>, passing in the system matrix, RHS vector, boundary entities, entity-to-index mapping, and current time.</li>
<li>The <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> iterates over each boundary entity, retrieves the assigned boundary condition, and applies it to the matrix and RHS vector according to the condition type (Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, or function-based variant).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solver Execution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>With boundary conditions integrated into the matrix and RHS, the solver executes its solution routine (e.g., using Krylov subspace methods as detailed in iterative solution literature【23†source】).</li>
<li>The solution obtained by the solver reflects the enforced boundary conditions, ensuring that variables behave as specified on the domain’s boundaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This workflow ensures that the boundary conditions are correctly represented within each solver iteration or time step, maintaining the physical constraints essential to an accurate CFD simulation.</p>
<h5 id="64-benefits-of-integration-with-domain-and-solver-modules"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#64-benefits-of-integration-with-domain-and-solver-modules">§</a>6.4 Benefits of Integration with Domain and Solver Modules</h5>
<p>The integration between the <code>Boundary</code>, <code>Domain</code>, and <code>Solver</code> modules offers several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accurate Boundary Representation</strong>: By embedding boundary conditions directly into the system matrix and RHS vector, the simulation accurately models boundary interactions such as fixed values, fluxes, or convective effects.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: The entity-to-index mapping allows for targeted modifications to the matrix and RHS, applying conditions only where necessary. This efficiency is essential for large-scale simulations where computational resources are a key consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Modularity and Flexibility</strong>: The modular design of the <code>Boundary</code> module allows it to adapt to various domain structures and solver requirements, supporting both steady-state and transient simulations with flexible boundary configurations.</li>
<li><strong>Parallelism and Scalability</strong>: The concurrent design of <code>BoundaryConditionHandler</code> and the separation of concerns between <code>Boundary</code>, <code>Domain</code>, and <code>Solver</code> modules lay the groundwork for future parallel execution, allowing for scalability in multi-threaded or distributed simulations.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="65-summary"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#65-summary">§</a>6.5 Summary</h5>
<p>The integration of the <code>Boundary</code> module with the <code>Domain</code> and <code>Solver</code> modules ensures that boundary conditions are applied accurately and efficiently in the simulation workflow. Through structured interactions with <code>MeshEntity</code> objects and the <code>entity_to_index</code> mapping, boundary conditions are seamlessly integrated into the solver’s matrix and RHS modifications, maintaining the physical fidelity of boundary interactions in the numerical solution. This cohesive integration supports accurate and scalable CFD simulations, providing a foundation for further extensions in multi-physics or large-scale fluid dynamics applications.</p>
