## 1. Introduction to Hydra

---

### 1.1 Purpose & Objectives

Hydra is an open-source computational framework designed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in geophysical fluid dynamics using the Finite Volume Method (FVM). The primary focus of Hydra is to simulate natural water bodies such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and coastal environments. By implementing the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, Hydra provides a robust platform for modeling turbulent flows in environmental-scale natural systems.

**Objectives:**

- **Accurate Simulation:** Provide high-fidelity simulations of fluid dynamics in complex geometries, accounting for turbulence and varying boundary conditions.
- **Flexibility:** Support structured and unstructured meshes to accommodate arbitrary geometries and boundary-fitted meshes.
- **Scalability:** Design for parallel execution and scalability to handle large-scale simulations efficiently.
- **Extensibility:** Allow developers to extend the framework with new equations, solvers, and models to meet specific research needs.

---

### 1.2 Project Scope

Hydra's architecture is modular, consisting of several key components that work together to simulate geophysical flows:

- **Section Structure:** Manages the organization of dynamic variables (e.g., velocity, pressure) alongside static mesh entities, allowing for efficient data access and manipulation.
- **Mesh and Geometry Handling:** Supports 3D, boundary-fitted meshes, including both structured and unstructured grids. Provides extrusion methods for converting 2D meshes into 3D geometries.
- **Solver Development:** Implements iterative and direct solvers optimized for sparse matrix systems arising from FVM discretization, including support for preconditioning techniques.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Offers flexible handling of various boundary conditions such as Dirichlet, Neumann, periodic, and reflective conditions, essential for dynamic simulations.
- **Time-Stepping Framework:** Incorporates explicit and implicit time-stepping methods, balancing accuracy and stability in transient simulations.
- **Input/Output Requirements:** Provides robust I/O functionality for loading initial conditions, configuring simulations, and exporting results for visualization and analysis.
- **Parallelization and Scalability:** Designed with future integration of MPI for distributed computing, enabling scalable simulations on multi-processor systems.
