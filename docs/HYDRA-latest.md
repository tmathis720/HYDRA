### Project Overview and Goal

The HYDRA project aims to develop a **Finite Volume Method (FVM)** solver for **geophysical fluid dynamics problems**, specifically targeting environments such as **coastal areas, estuaries, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs**. The project focuses on solving the **Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations**, which are fundamental for simulating fluid flow in these complex environments.

Our approach closely follows the structural and functional organization of the **PETSc** library, particularly in mesh management, parallelization, and solver routines. Key PETSc modules—like `DMPlex` for mesh topology, `KSP` for linear solvers, `PC` for preconditioners, and `TS` for time-stepping—serve as inspiration for organizing our solvers, mesh infrastructure, and preconditioners. The ultimate goal is to create a **modular, scalable solver framework** capable of handling the complexity of RANS equations for geophysical applications.

### Conceptual Basis, Structure, and Usage of `KSP` and `Domain` Modules

#### **Domain Module**

The `Domain` module is designed to manage the computational mesh and its associated data, mirroring the functionality of PETSc's `DMPlex` module. It provides a flexible and efficient way to represent mesh entities, their relationships, and associated data without embedding additional data directly into the mesh entities themselves.

##### **Key Components**

- **Mesh Entities (`MeshEntity`)**:
  - Represents fundamental elements of the mesh: **Vertices**, **Edges**, **Faces**, and **Cells**.
  - Each `MeshEntity` is uniquely identified by its type and ID.
  - Remains lightweight and does not store additional data or tags.

- **Sieve Data Structure (`Sieve`)**:
  - Manages adjacency and incidence relationships between mesh entities.
  - Provides hierarchical operations like `cone`, `closure`, `support`, and `star` to navigate the mesh topology.
  - Enables efficient traversal and manipulation of the mesh structure.

- **Sections (`Section`)**:
  - A generic data structure used to associate arbitrary data with mesh entities.
  - Acts as a mapping from `MeshEntity` to data of any type `T`.
  - Facilitates the association of **tags**, **functions**, **physical properties**, and other metadata with mesh entities without modifying the entities themselves.
  - Example usages:
    - Associating coefficient functions with cells.
    - Storing boundary condition functions for faces.
    - Tagging entities with region identifiers.

- **Mesh (`Mesh`)**:
  - Combines the `Sieve` and mesh entities to represent the entire mesh.
  - Includes methods for geometric computations, such as calculating centroids, areas, and distances.
  - Does not store additional data within entities, promoting separation of concerns.

- **Overlap and Parallelism (`Overlap`, `Delta`)**:
  - Manages relationships between local and ghost entities for parallel computations.
  - Ensures data consistency across partitions in distributed computing environments.
  - Facilitates efficient communication and data exchange between processes.

- **Stratification and Reordering**:
  - Organizes mesh entities into strata based on their dimension (e.g., vertices in stratum 0, edges in stratum 1).
  - Provides reordering algorithms (e.g., Cuthill-McKee) to improve memory locality and solver performance.

##### **Usage of Sections**

By utilizing `Section`, we can associate data with mesh entities flexibly:

- **Associating Tags and Regions**:
  - Create a `Section<FxHashSet<String>>` to map entities to a set of tags.
  - Tags can represent regions, boundary types, or material properties.
  - Enables grouping entities without modifying `MeshEntity`.

- **Associating Functions**:
  - Use `Section<FunctionType>` to associate functions (e.g., coefficient functions, source terms) with entities.
  - Supports spatially varying properties and complex physical behaviors.

- **Handling Boundary Conditions**:
  - Associate boundary condition functions with entities representing boundaries.
  - Allows for flexible and customizable boundary treatments.

##### **Example**

```rust
// Define a coefficient function type
type CoefficientFn = Box<dyn Fn(&[f64]) -> f64 + Send + Sync>;

// Create a Section to associate coefficient functions with MeshEntity
let mut coefficient_section = Section::<CoefficientFn>::new();

// Define and associate a coefficient function with a cell entity
let cell_entity = MeshEntity::Cell(1);
coefficient_section.set_data(cell_entity, Box::new(|position| {
    // Coefficient logic
    1.0
}));
```

#### **KSP Module**

The `KSP` (Krylov Subspace Methods) module implements linear solvers, mirroring PETSc's `KSP` module. It provides a flexible framework for solving linear systems arising from PDE discretizations.

##### **Key Components**

- **KSP Trait (`KSP`)**:
  - Defines a common interface for all Krylov subspace solvers.
  - Ensures that different solvers can be used interchangeably.

- **Conjugate Gradient Solver (`ConjugateGradient`)**:
  - Implements the Conjugate Gradient method for symmetric positive-definite systems.
  - Supports optional preconditioning through the `Preconditioner` trait.
  - Integrates with the `Domain` module for matrix and vector operations.

- **Preconditioners (`Preconditioner` Trait)**:
  - Defines an interface for preconditioners used to accelerate solver convergence.
  - Implementations include **Jacobi** and **LU** preconditioners.
  - Can be applied without modifying the underlying matrix or solver structures.

- **Matrix and Vector Traits**:
  - Abstract over different matrix and vector types.
  - Allow the solver to work with various data structures, including those from external crates like `faer`.

##### **Usage**

```rust
// Create a Conjugate Gradient solver
let mut cg_solver = ConjugateGradient::new(max_iter, tolerance);

// Optionally set a preconditioner
let preconditioner = Box::new(Jacobi::new(&a_matrix));
cg_solver.set_preconditioner(preconditioner);

// Solve the linear system
let result = cg_solver.solve(&a_matrix, &b_vector, &mut x_vector);
```

### **Addition of `TS`-like Framework**

To handle time-dependent problems, we've introduced a `TS`-like framework in HYDRA, inspired by PETSc's `TS` module. This framework integrates with both the `Domain` and `KSP` modules.

#### **Key Components**

- **TimeStepper Trait (`TimeStepper`)**:
  - Defines the interface for time-stepping methods.
  - Supports both explicit and implicit schemes.

- **TimeDependentProblem Trait (`TimeDependentProblem`)**:
  - Represents the ODE/DAE problem to be solved.
  - Allows users to define custom functions for:
    - **Initial conditions**
    - **Boundary conditions**
    - **Source terms**
    - **Coefficients**

- **Implementations of Time-Stepping Methods**:
  - **Forward Euler**: An explicit method suitable for simple problems.
  - **Runge-Kutta Methods**: Higher-order explicit methods.
  - **Implicit Methods**: Such as Backward Euler and Crank-Nicolson, which require solving linear systems at each time step.

#### **Integration with Mesh and Solvers**

- **Mesh Interaction**:
  - The `TimeDependentProblem` can access mesh entities and associated data via `Section`.
  - Supports spatially varying coefficients and source terms.

- **Solver Interaction**:
  - Implicit time-stepping methods utilize the `KSP` module to solve linear systems arising from discretization.
  - Preconditioners can be applied to improve solver performance.

#### **Usage Example**

```rust
struct MyProblem {
    mesh: Mesh,
    coefficient_section: Section<CoefficientFn>,
    // Other fields
}

impl TimeDependentProblem for MyProblem {
    type State = Vec<f64>;
    type Time = f64;

    fn compute_rhs(
        &self,
        time: Self::Time,
        state: &Self::State,
        derivative: &mut Self::State,
    ) -> Result<(), ProblemError> {
        // Compute the RHS using mesh and coefficient_section
        Ok(())
    }

    // Implement other required methods...
}

// Set up the time stepper
let mut time_stepper = ForwardEuler::new();

// Time-stepping loop
while current_time < end_time {
    time_stepper.step(&problem, current_time, dt, &mut state)?;
    current_time += dt;
}
```
