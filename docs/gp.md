### Project Overview and Goal

The HYDRA project aims to develop a **Finite Volume Method (FVM)** solver for **geophysical fluid dynamics problems**, specifically targeting environments such as **coastal areas, estuaries, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs**. The project focuses on solving the **Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations**, which are fundamental for simulating fluid flow in these complex environments.

Our approach closely follows the structural and functional organization of the **PETSc** library, particularly in mesh management, parallelization, and solver routines. Key PETSc modules—like `DMPlex` for mesh topology, `KSP` for linear solvers, `PC` for preconditioners, and `TS` for time-stepping—serve as inspiration for organizing our solvers, mesh infrastructure, and preconditioners. The ultimate goal is to create a **modular, scalable solver framework** capable of handling the complexity of RANS equations for geophysical applications.
